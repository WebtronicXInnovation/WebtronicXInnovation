This file provides a brief overview of the website's structure and functionality.

Project Description:

WebTronix Innovation is a startup website showcasing your innovative ideas and services. This website uses a simple and clear layout with a focus on user experience.

Website Structure:

The website utilizes a menu bar at the top for easy navigation, containing the following sections:

Home: This page serves as the landing page, introducing your company, its mission, and core offerings.
Services: This section details the services your company provides to potential clients. Be sure to clearly explain the benefits of each service.
Features: Here, you can highlight the unique features that set your company apart from the competition. This could involve innovative technologies, methodologies, or any other differentiating factors.
Team: Introduce your team members and their expertise. This helps build trust and credibility with potential clients.
Contact: Provide clear contact information, including email address, phone number (if applicable), and a contact form for inquiries.
Getting Started:

This repository assumes you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript.

Please Note:

This is a basic website structure. You can customize it further by adding additional pages, sections, or functionalities as needed.
Replace the placeholder content with your own company information, services, team details, and contact information.
Ensure you have a web hosting service set up to deploy this website online.
